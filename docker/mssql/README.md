When Miscrosoft actually release the Linux version of SQLServer (currently only available in press releases) we will attempt to build a container for it.

In the mean time, we can use the [sqsh client](http://wfau.metagrid.co.uk/code/firethorn/file/tip/firethorn-sqlserver/src/Dockerfile) and [SSH tunnel](http://wfau.metagrid.co.uk/code/firethorn/file/tip/docker/sql-tunnel/Dockerfile) containers from the [Firethorn](http://redmine.roe.ac.uk/projects/wva) project to run the tests on our SQLserver system at ROE.
